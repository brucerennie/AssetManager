AssetManager
============

Development of a generic asset management software system. The assets to be covered include 
everything from buildings, rooms, fixed assets (such as air conditioning sysytems) down 
to phones and computers.

The initial thoughts for the system are to include a life-cycle module and work request/order 
module. Interfaces to external finance systems and purchasing systems are to be worked on.

The reason for this project is the problems experienced with commercial systems (unnamed at 
this point) which have not be conducive to molding the business asset requirements. These
commercial systems are very expensive for small businesses and groups.

This project is an attempt to provide a system for use by small organisations in the management 
of their assets.

The initial system will be designed using PostgreSQL as the data repository (in keeping with 
the open source nature of the project).
